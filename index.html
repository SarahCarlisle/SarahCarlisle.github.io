  <p>I have a passion for developing individuals as well as a team who work effectively and efficiently and are centered toward achieving mutual goals.  One of my favorite compliments I received from a team member was, “I don’t know If anyone has told you this yet, but I really appreciate your organizational skills.  I feel like I actually have a direction now.”</p>

    <h2><b>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</b></h2>
    <h4><b>NOVEMBER 2017 – PRESENT</b></h4>
    <h3><b>OWNER, TRAVEL ESCAPE ROOM</b></h3>
    <p>My passion for team building lead me to create Travel Escape Room, LLC.  We are Minnesota and North Dakota’s first Mobile Escape Room.  I love that I founded a company that allows my creative and innovative mind to blossom!  As a small business owner, I learned many tools to grown my company; from Website Design, 3D Character Animation, Social Media Marketing, to Video Editing; I’ve learned so many valuable skills at this job, and I learn more every day.<p>
    <br/>
    <h4><b>AUGUST 2018 – PRESENT</b></h4>
    <h3><b>LEAD TEACHER, INSPIRE INNOVATION LAB</b></h3>
    <p>This Lab’s mission is to provide professional development, student programming, and innovative learning experiences with a focus towards the empowerment of underrepresented groups.  It’s an incredibly difficult job that is incredibly rewarding.  As a teacher, I provide STEAM based exploratory learning but we also have a huge focus on mental health and teaching children cooping strategies.  This is a learn on the fly kind of job, as we strive to keep up to date on the latest teaching methodologies and mental health practices.<p>
    <br/>
    <h4><b>AUGUST 2010 - MARCH 2018</b></h4>
    <h3><b>SENIOR PROJECT COORDINATOR, HERE TECHNOLOGIES</b></h3>
    <p>Using a Six Sigma approach, I was Project Coordinator for six programs, ~230 projects quarterly, spread across four Production Centers (around 200 employees) with stakeholders on five continents. Proven success in managing multiple priorities in high paced work environment by being named Nokia Impact Award winner, and 2-time Manager of Projects that have received awards for Program of the Quarter.<p>
    <br/>
    <h4><b>MARCH 2008 - AUG 2010</b></h4>
    <h3><b>PROJECT LEADER, NAVTEQ</b></h3>
    <p>As PL, I managed employees and several high priority projects.  I directly managed 50 employees and over one hundred remotely at locations across the globe.  I coordinated projects quarterly; upwards of 50,000 hours’ of work/quarter.  My proudest achievement as PL was leading my team through what I truly believe to be an overwhelmingly successful transition of a Project to Mumbai, IN and Leon, MX production centers.  I gage this success on many factors; transitioning processes with no impact to delivery schedule, no significant increases to DBE fix requests, the camaraderie that was established between the teams across the globe, and the confidence my team exerted during the transition.<p>
